  "Review Content": "I already own alot of headphone, but I don't like using them outside of the house because they are huge and anoying to carry around ( sennheiser, akg, especialy my grado those are really ugly). So I decided to buy these small little earbuds, and these panasonic earbuds sound quite good. Good bass, clean sound, and they are inexpensive. They fit in your ear nicely, unlike my apple earbuds which fall out of my ears every 5 seconds. Enough pros now to the cons, the cord is really thin and easily get tangle, the jack plug is pretty big and doesn't fit my iphone case, but I fixed it by cut off a little bit of rubber around the plug with a knife, and now they fit perfectly.",
