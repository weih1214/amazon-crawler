  "Review Content": "I can't believe these are so cheap! These sound fantastic. I mean I can feel myself getting fitter and more productive already. I put on a \"running\" song to try out the quality and I immediately wanted to go running. I don't really run. At least I haven't in a while. I think I'll go now. Or maybe I'll clean the house...something that involves moving. I got purple cause every color is a slightly different price and they were one of the cheapest. I actually ended up liking the color. It comes with 3 different size rubber tips to fit your size ears.",
