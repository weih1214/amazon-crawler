  "Review Content": "Ear buds seem to fit well and sound fine, but the plug end is too large for my phone case. Wasn't a problem on my old ear buds. They also tangled badly 10 minutes out of the package. Which made me realize there isn't the plastic slide piece to help keep them organized. I know these are small things but thought they were worth mentioning.",
